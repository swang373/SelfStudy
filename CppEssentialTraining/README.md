These are my notebooks for the "C++ Essential Training" course on inLearning taught by Bill Weinman.

### Introduction

The C++ programming language is a general purpose programming language that supports coding paradigms such as object-oriented, procedural, functional, and generic programming. It began as an extended version of C, "C with classes", and was developed in the late 1970's by Bjarne Stroustrup. Over 40 years later, it remains one of the top five best practice progamming languages. It is used to write code at all levels: firmware, operating systems, and large scale applications.

The C++ programming language is made up of different components, each of which can be considered their own separate language with distinct grammars:
* C language, the basis of C++
* C preprocessor
* Classes and objects, used for object-oriented programming
* Templates, used for generic programming
* Standard Template Library (STL), provides a tremendous amount of functionality

The versions of the C++ standard are ratified by the ISO. The first version was C++98, which was followed by a bugfix version C++03. The second version is C++11, which was the first major extension to the standard that provided new features: range-based for-loops, type inference, lambda functions, an unambiguous null pointer constant, and other improvements. The versions which followed, C++14 and C++17, primarily provide refinements of existing features.

This course uses C++14.
